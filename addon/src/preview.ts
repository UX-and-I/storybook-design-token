/**
 * A decorator is a way to wrap a story in extra “rendering” functionality. Many addons define decorators
 * in order to augment stories:
 * - with extra rendering
 * - gather details about how a story is rendered
 *
 * When writing stories, decorators are typically used to wrap stories with extra markup or context mocking.
